        <p class="right box-model text-box-2">
            “This book series is one of the most interesting things I have ever read. <br>
            It has such an incredibly weird style of worldbuilding and storytelling that I can't help but love it.<br>
            It's like a tangent in book form. One minute you're incredibly invested in the ultimate question to <br>
            the ultimate answer (42) and the next you're on the planet of the space hobo who makes every important decision <br>
            in the universe. It has such a unique sense of humor too. It might come off as random to some, but <br>
            everything has a purpose. There are random facts that are brought up and then used later as a punchline to a joke. <br>
            And these jokes and their punchline build the foundation for the story. As a result, even when the book has a  serious moment, <br>
            it's impossible to take it seriously, because everything is so strange and odd and funny. Over time <br>
            these little tidbits that are first used for a single gag develop into major plot points, which shape the story and the jokes being told. <br>
            As a result, it's hard not to see the entire story as one big elaborate joke. And if that's your kinda thing, you'll love this book.” <br>

        <h2 class="center box-model-2-b title-box">OUTLANDER</h2>
        <p class="right box-model text-box-2">
            “I've read that Outlander was originally marketed as a romance novel because the publisher <br>
            didn't know what else to do with it, but this book is no ordinary romance novel. It doesn't follow any typical<br>
            romance formula and is a real genre bender that doesn't fit neatly into any one category. Outlander has a swoon-worthy <br>
            hero and dozens of truly romantic scenes that should be sufficient to satisfy even the most discriminating <br>
            romance reader, while it's time travel aspect and a few references to   witches and fairies should be of interest to readers <br>
            of fantasy and paranormal stories. At it's heart though Outlander is a historical novel rife with details of 18th century <br>
            life in the Scottish Highlands both inside and outside a castle or large estate. It also recounts some of the events <br>
            leading up to the Jacobite Pretender's Uprising of 1745. Diana Gabaldon is an amazing writer who delves deep into her character's <br>
            lives and the history surrounding them, painting an extraordinary picture that truly transports the reader to another <br>
            time and place.”<br><br>

        <p class="right box-model text-box-2">
            “This is one of those books riding the coattails of its betters. Recently, there have been a ton of fictional books aiming to <br>
             incorporate or rework some part of the Ancient world, from Natalie Haynes to Pat Barker to Kamila Shamsie and more. However, this <br>
             is something else entirely. It certainly has neither the power of Greek myth nor the quality of Secret History. It doesn’t even hit <br>
             the acceptable levels for a decent modern thriller. In fact, it is PAINFULLY bad. The plodding, simplistic style. The stilted, <br>
             unnatural conversations. The apparently profound moments. The stereotyping of every character worsened by ridiculous descriptions, <br>
            ‘despite all this trauma, Henry was a remarkably intelligent person’. What has trauma got to do with intelligence? The whole thing is like this.”<br><br>
